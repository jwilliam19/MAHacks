			<font id="FirstPara">
			Many people in the world don't have access to clean water or food, 
			and have to wait days for their next meal.<br/> <br/>
			They often struggle with this throughout their life, and go without 
			the things that we take for granted everyday. <br/><br/>
			Our mission is to make sure that everyone has the chance to give to those in need,
			even if they canâ€™t afford it.<br/><br/>
			What our website does is generate money through sponsorships and ad 
			revenue to be able to give to the less fortunate.<br/><br/>
			There is no signup needed, all you need to do is start up the game to play,
			and watch as the amount you make progresses along with the game.

			What if everyday you went to bed not knowing when your next meal was going to be? <br/><br/>
			
			
			What if everyday you went to school wondering if they were going to have food to eat?<br/><br/>
			
			
			These are the many, many problems that people have to face on a daily basis when living in poverty stricken areas. <br/><br/>
			
			
			We wanted to create a way for anybody to be able to contribue to a cause they cared about while at the 
			same time being able to afford and enjoy it.<br/><br/>
                        
            We are non-profit organization, which means that we make no money from this website. All revenue goes directly to charity.<br/><br/>
			We generate the money thought ads and vistors on the website itself, and this is how we calcualted how much money someone
			can make when they play the game.
